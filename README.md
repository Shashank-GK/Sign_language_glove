# Sign_language_glove

The Arduino-based Sign Language Glove is a wearable device designed to translate sign language gestures into text, enabling effective communication between sign language users and non-sign language users. This open-source project utilizes an Arduino Uno board, flex sensors, an LCD display, and various other components. The glove detects finger movements using flex sensors and translates them into corresponding text on an LCD display. The project includes Arduino code, circuit diagrams, and documentation to help others understand and replicate the system. By adding this project to GitHub, we aim to share our work, encourage collaboration, and contribute to the advancement of accessible communication technologies. Join us in making communication inclusive and empowering for everyone.
